			<h3>Let’s get started.</h3>
			<p>The below will tell us a bit about how you think, who you are, and how you’ll respond to different types of personalities as partners. Select ONE paragraph in each of the following two groups of statements that best reflects your general attitudes and behaviors, as you have been most of your life.</p>
            <p>You do not have to agree completely with every word or statement in the paragraph you select. You may agree with only 80-90% of a particular paragraph and still select that paragraph over the other two in the group. However, you should agree with the general tone and overall “philosophy” of the paragraph you select. You will probably disagree with some part of each of the paragraphs. Do not reject a paragraph because of a single work or phrase! Again, look at the overall picture.</p>
            <p>Do not overanalyze your choices. Select the paragraph that your ‘gut feeling’ says is the right one for you, even though you may not agree with 100% of it. The general thrust and feeling of the paragraph as a whole is more important than individual elements of it. Go with your intuition. There’s no wrong answer.</p>
